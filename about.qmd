This website is a public interface to the inventory of the permanent collection of the [University Museum](https://univmuseum.nmsu.edu/){target="_blank"} of the New Mexico State University ([NMSU](https://nmsu.edu/){target="_blank"}). The site aims to increase access of the collections for teaching, research, exhibition, collaborative outreach, and training.

Construction of this inventory was supported by generous support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services ([IMLS](https://www.imls.gov/){target="_blank"}) *Inspire!* Grants for Small Museums Award [IGSM-248937-OMS-21](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/igsm-248937-oms-21){target="_blank"}.

The site also serves as a proof of concept that searchable interfaces to small museum collections can be built with free and open source software. This site was built with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), relies heavily on the [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) JavaScript library, its R wrapper [`DT`](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/), and the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing engine.
