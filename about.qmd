This website is a public interface to the inventory of the permanent collection of the [University Museum](https://univmuseum.nmsu.edu/){target="_blank"} of the New Mexico State University ([NMSU](https://nmsu.edu/){target="_blank"}). The site aims to increase access of the collections for teaching, research, exhibition, collaborative outreach, and training.[^1]

[^1]: The site also serves as a proof of concept that searchable interfaces to small museum collections can be built with free and open source software. This site was built with [R](https://www.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} and relies heavily on the [`DT`](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/){target="_blank"} library which is a wrapper for the [DataTables](https://datatables.net/){target="_blank"} JavaScript library. The [Quarto](https://quarto.org/){target="_blank"} publishing engine, which leverages [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/){target="_blank"}, was used to render the output. To review the code, clone the repository, or file an issue, please visit the project's GitHub [repository](https://github.com/n8craig/um-inventory){target="_blank"}.
