University Museum Collections Inventory

This repository contains the code to build a searchable interface for museum collections that are stored in a PastPerfect database.

> **Note**
> Several key parts of the data are not included in this repository. There are two reasons: some of the data are sensitive and not appropriate for public display, 2) the original uncompressed images are large.
